<br><br>

This sample game was started from Photon's [Fusion Battle Royale Sample](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/game-samples/fusion-br/quickstart)
<br><br>

### Overview

The original [Hathora<>Photon Fusion BR Sample](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/game-samples/fusion-br/quickstart) was a Photon Fusion full game sample that has added:

* Hathora SDK
* Hathora high-level wrappers
* HathoraServerConfig build, deployment and room mgmt utils

Check it out to learn more about hosting Photon Fusion on Hathora Cloud and accessing the Hathora SDK. We have made a few modifications to make this game easily deployable with a dedicated server on [Hathora Cloud](https://hathora.dev/docs).

## Getting the project
### Direct download

 - select `Code` and select the 'Download Zip' option.  Please note that this will download the branch you're currently viewing on Github
<br><br>

## Requirements

- This sample game is compatible with the latest Unity Long Term Support (LTS) editor version, currently [2021 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/2021-lts). Please include **Linux Dedicated Server Build Support** in your installation, as well as **Linux Build Support (Mono)**.

- [Photon account](https://www.photonengine.com/fusion) with an active app created (for `AppId`).

- [Hathora Cloud account](https://console.hathora.dev) with an active app created (for `AppId`).

- 
<br><br>

## Steps

1. If building your Linux headless server via `HathoraServerConfig`, the Dockerfile will automatically add the `-args` necessary to start "as a server
    - To see the default args, see [./hathora/Dockerfile](https://github.com/hathora/photon-fusion-br/blob/main/.hathora/Dockerfile) - or the official [Photon docs](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/game-samples/fusion-br/quickstart)

2. Use the Hathora Unity plugin to configure, build, and deploy your server on Hathora Cloud via `Assets/Hathora/HathoraServerConfig`. See [Hathora Unity Plugin](https://github.com/hathora/unity-plugin)
    - After setting up, serialize @ `Menu` scene's `HathoraManager` GameObject's `HathoraServerConfig`.
    - At the same spot, also serialize `HathoraClientConfig` next to the same file.

4. Once deployed, create a room in Hathora Cloud via any method:
  - Create via `Menu` scene (as a Client): Click "Create" button at the bottom-right (adds a browsable Lobby)
  - via `Hathora ServerConfig`: Click "Create Room" button in the "Create Room" dropdown group
  - via [Hathora Console](https://console.hathora.dev) in your browser at the top-right

5. Play the `Menu` scene and join the new Room that appeared in a browsable Lobby list.

## Altered Photon Files

Within this repro, we have already made changes to support Hathora. However, if you are interested in the core changes, in order of importance:

1. [Asssets/TPSBR/Scripts/Networking/Networking.cs](https://github.com/hathora/photon-fusion-br/blob/main/Assets/TPSBR/Scripts/Networking/Networking.cs)
    * At `ConnectPeerCoroutine()`, if **Server** GameMode: Get Hathora Cloud Proccess/Room info to set Photon `startGameArgs`. Server name, max # of players, etc.

2. [Assets/HathoraPhoton/HathoraMatchmaking.cs](https://github.com/hathora/photon-fusion-br/blob/main/Assets/HathoraPhoton/HathoraMatchmaking.cs)
    * We override Photon's `Matchmaking.cs` to check if the user created a new Lobby from the `Menu` scene. Pure Photon will have the user be both a Client and Server. In Hathora, we want to create a dedicated server in the cloud (rather than have the player host as a server).

3. Assets/TPSBR/Scenes/Menu.unity
    * Added HathoraManager GameObject with manager scripts. 
      * **(!)** Serialize your selected `HathoraServerConfig` & `HathoraClientConfig` files here!
      * Added `HathoraCreateDoneTxt` & `HathoraCCreateStatusTxt` for status texts.
      * Renamed `Matchmaking` prefab to `HathoraMatchmaking` -> Swapped `Matchmaking.cs` with `HathoraMatchmaking.cs`.
          * When the users clicks "Create": instead of locally hosting as a server, we'll create a Hathora Cloud dedicated server (Room with Lobby) and show the Lobby list.

### Region Mapping

Within the demo, we have included [HathoraRegionMap.cs](https://github.com/hathora/photon-fusion-br/blob/main/Assets/HathoraPhoton/HathoraRegionMap.cs) to map the following Photon<>Hathora regions:

**<< Photon : Hathora >>**
- "us" : Washingington DC
- "usw" : Seattle
- "asia" : Singapore210
- "jp" : Tokyo
- "eu" : Frankfurt
- "sa" : SaoPaulo
- "kr" : Singapore

## Default Dockerfile launch argss

- `-batchmode` | Unity arg to run as headlesss server
- `-nographics` | Unity arg to skips shaders/GUI; requires `-batchmode`
- `-dedicatedServer` | Photon arg to automatically start as dedicated server
- `-deathmatch` | Photon arg to automatically start `deathmatch` game mode
- `-maxPlayers 5` | Photon arg
- `-scene GenArea2` | Photon arg
- `-region us` | Photon arg; see Photon<>Hathora mapping in the section below
- `-serverName hathoraDeployedServer` | Shows up in the lobby List under name
- `-sessionName hathoraDeployedServerSession` | Photon arg; unknown use (arbitrary?)
- `-port 7777` | The default and recommended Docker container port
- `-mode server` | Hathora arg to start as Server when using a `HathoraArgHandler` script; unnecessary in Photon.

## Other samples
### Hathora Unity Plugin
[Hathora Unity Plugin (with FishNet and Mirror demos)](https://github.com/hathora/hathora-unity) is our Unity Plugin that comes with FishNet and Mirror networking demos. It allows you to deploy your game on Hathora Cloud directly from our editor plugin.

### Unity NGO Sample
[@hathora/unity-ngo-sample](https://github.com/hathora/unity-ngo-sample) takes Unity's 2D Space Shooter sample game with *Unity NetCode for Game Objects* (NGO) and modifies it to be easily deployable on Hathora Cloud.
